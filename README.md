A web app for generating Undertale dialog boxes. 
NOW LIVE at http://ianmccowan.nfshost.com/undertale/!

Made using the extremely nice and cool [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) language.
I wholeheartedly endorse it as an introduction to functional programming
OR a radical reworking of front-end web development!

The backend uses [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org),
which isn't quite as exciting but extremely simple and easy to use!
